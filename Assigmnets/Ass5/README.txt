We have 3 LABS so far. 

1. The ATM Stand Alone that you were supposed to place an array and simulate the database. This is the one I explained in detail in the On Demand webinar link.

2. The same ATM Object however now exposed completely as a Web Service. (link is pending).

3. A Client Angular App that will talk (consume) the Web Service mentioned above (2.).    

I will provide a video explaining in detail how to build them for the solution. For the last one (3.) I will provide only part of it so you can complete it by the weekend. Please, review the webinars, that will serve you a lot, it takes more or less 4-5 hours to record them and then upload them.
